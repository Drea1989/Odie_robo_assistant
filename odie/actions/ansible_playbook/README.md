# ansible_playbook

## Synopsis

Run an Ansible playbook. Ansible is a free-software platform for configuring and managing computers which combines multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task execution, and configuration management.

Playbooks are Ansibleâ€™s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.

This action can be used to perform complex operation with all [modules available from Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules.html).

## Installation

CORE ACTION : No installation needed.  

## Options

| sudo_user     | NO       |         |         | The target user with admin privileges. In most of case "root" |

## Neuron example

### Playbook without admin privileges

Call the playbook named playbook.yml
```yml
  - name: "Ansible-test"
    cues:
      - order: "playbook"
    actions:
      - ansible_playbook: 
          task_file: "playbook.yml"
      - say:
          message: "The task is done"
```

Content of the playbook. This playbook will use the [URI module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/uri_module.html) to interact with a webservice on a remote server.
```yml
- name: Playbook
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local

  tasks:   
    - name: "Call api"
      uri:
          url: "http://192.168.0.17:8000/app"
          HEADER_Content-Type: "application/json"
          method: POST
          user: admin
          password: secret
          force_basic_auth: yes
          status_code: 201
          body_format: json
          body: >
            {"app_name": "music", "state": "start"}
```

### Playbook with admin privileges

In some cases, a playbook requires sudo right to perform admin operations like installing a package.
In this case, you must give to the action the login and password of the user which has admin privileges.
```yml
  - name: "Ansible-root"
    cues:
      - order: "playbook"
    actions:
      - ansible_playbook:
          task_file: "playbook-root.yml"
          sudo: true
          sudo_user: "root"
          sudo_password: "secret"
```

And the playbook would be. Notice that we use `become: True`
```yml
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local
  become: True

  tasks:
    - name: "Install a useful train package"
      apt:
        name: sl
        state: present
```

## Note

Ansible contains a lot of modules that can be useful for Odie

- [Notification](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_notification_modules.html): can be used to send a message to Pushbullet, IRC channel, Rocket Chat and a lot of other notification services
- [Files](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_files_modules.html): can be used to perform a backup or synchronize two file path
- [Windows](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_windows_modules.html): Can be used to control a Windows Desktop

Shell action or script action can perform the same tasks. Ansible is just a way to simplify some execution or enjoy some [already made plugin](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html).
